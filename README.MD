# The Why and the When to use functional techniques.

<p>The Why, the When & Real World examples are often missing from any treatment on functional programming.
I am going to attempt to fill that gap here.
</p>
<p>
This is a code repository. But, it's also a book. I use READMEs, comments and code to exlain techniques and provide real world examples.
</p>

<p>
If time permits, I may author a more traditional book format version of this.
I may create a YouTube video series.
For now, it is a brain dump.
</p>
<p>
I will provide the occasional tests. I don't plan to clutter things up with a bunch of console logs. So, I recommend something like <a href='https://quokkajs.com/' target='_blank'>Quokka</a> which is currently available for VS Code, Atom and WebStorm. Other than that, all you need is node. 
</p>
<p>
Only one dependency as of now. I have introduced <a href='https://ramdajs.com/' target='_blank'>Ramda</a> to help explain some things. In fact, this is turning in to a deep dive in to Ramda. I don't plan to turn this in to a quasi-functional library project. I may also bring in some other libraries to demonstate other functional concepts.
